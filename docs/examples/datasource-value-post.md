# Add datavalue to datasource

## Simple example - value and valueDate

This is the simplest form of a DataValue. The fields `value` and `valueDate` is always required by default  

Request

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 2
}
```

Response

```http
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
location: /v1/datasources/1348/values/291411700
```

```json
{
  "id": 291411700,
  "dataSourceId": 1348,
  "registrationDate": "2024-10-14T12:26:15.8816103Z",
  "areaId": null,
  "assetId": null,
  "projectId": null,
  "value": 2,
  "description": null,
  "dimension": null,
  "dimension2": null,
  "dimension3": null,
  "dimension4": null,
  "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00Z",
  "externalId": null
}
```

## Datavalue dimensions

From the previous payload you can see there are more columns in a Datavalue

The more advanced scenario is to including one or more dimensions. This allows for filtering of dataValues in DigiLEAN.

The nature of the dimensions are somewhat dynamic. So based on configuration the values that is to be posted might vary.

### The configuration

The configuration is set up in the DigiLEAN web client and can be fetched by the API by getting the Datasource details:

```http
GET https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/1348
content-type: application/json
```

Response

```json
{
  "id": 498,
  "title": "1A API documentation",
  "description": "API documentation",
  "objectSource": "external",
  "unitOfTime": "DAY",
  "primaryInputSource": "manual",
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": 707,
      "label": "Plain text",
      "type": "text",
      "isMandatory": true,
      "sourceColumn": "dimension",
      "dataSourceId": 498
    }
  ]
}
```

Inspect the `elements` array of the response here. 

The three important properties are
 - `sourceColumn` - which column in the dataValue object
 - `type` - what kind of data to enter
 - `isMandatory` - whether the field is required


### The dynamic dimensions

#### Dynamic dimension columns
The following columns can have different data based on the configuration

 - dimension
 - dimension2
 - dimension3
 - dimension4

### Dynamic dimension types

 - `text`: free text up to 100 unicode characters
 - `number`: number with digits
 - `bool`: true or false
 - `list`: Id from a DataList. The config will contain a `dataListId` field as well for this option
 - `user`: User id of a DigiLEAN user

### The static dimensions
- type `description` - column `description`: free text up to 255 unicode characters
- type `asset` - column `assetId`: Id of a DigiLEAN group
- type `project` - column `projectId`: Id of a DigiLEAN project

### Other columns

`externalId` is a optional column just meant for keeping track when you synchronize from external sources etc. It can contain up to 100 unicode characters. It's not used for anything in DigiLEAN.


## Dimension type text example

To post a dimension of type `text` or `description` post the text dimension along with the values and valueDate:

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 2,
    "dimension": "short text",
    "description": "long text"
}
```

## Dimension type number example

To post a dimension of type `number` post the number as a string. The supported type is `Double-precision floating-point` and you must use period (.) as decimal separator.

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 1,
    "dimension": "2.5"
}
```

## Dimension type bool example

To post a dimension of type `bool` post `true` or `false` as strings

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 1,
    "dimension": "false"
}
```
