# Add datavalue to datasource

## Simple example - value and valueDate

This is the simplest form of a DataValue. The fields `value` and `valueDate` is always required by default  

Request

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 2
}
```

Response

```http
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
location: /v1/datasources/1348/values/291411700
```

```json
{
  "id": 291411700,
  "dataSourceId": 1348,
  "registrationDate": "2024-10-14T12:26:15.8816103Z",
  "areaId": null,
  "assetId": null,
  "projectId": null,
  "value": 2,
  "description": null,
  "dimension": null,
  "dimension2": null,
  "dimension3": null,
  "dimension4": null,
  "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00Z",
  "externalId": null
}
```

## Datavalue dimensions

From the previous payload you can see there are more columns in a Datavalue

The more advanced scenario is to including one or more dimensions. This allows for filtering of dataValues in DigiLEAN.

The nature of the dimensions are somewhat dynamic. So based on configuration the values that is to be posted might vary.

### The configuration

The configuration is set up in the DigiLEAN web client and can be fetched by the API by getting the Datasource details:

```http
GET https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/1348
content-type: application/json
```

Response

```json
{
  "id": 498,
  "title": "1A API documentation",
  "description": "API documentation",
  "objectSource": "external",
  "unitOfTime": "DAY",
  "primaryInputSource": "manual",
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": 707,
      "label": "Plain text",
      "type": "text",
      "isMandatory": true,
      "sourceColumn": "dimension",
      "dataSourceId": 498
    }
  ]
}
```

Inspect the `elements` array of the response here. 

The three important properties are
 - `sourceColumn` - which column in the data object
 - `type` - what kind of data and what to enter
 - `isMandatory` - whether the field is required


### The dynamic dimension

#### dynamic columns
The following columns can have different data based on the configuration

 - dimension
 - dimension2
 - dimension3
 - dimension4

### dynamic types

 - text: free text up to 100 characters
 - number: number with digits
 - bool: true or false
 - list: Id from a DataList. The config will contain a `dataListId` field as well for this option
 - user: User id of a DigiLEAN user

### The static dimensions
- type *description* - column description: free text up to 255 characters
- type *asset* - column assetId: Id of DigiLEAN group
- type *project* - column projectId: Id of DigiLEAN project

### Other dimensions

`externalId` is a optional column just meant for keeping track of IDs when you import from external sources. 
If a third party system has IDs for its values you can use this to store their ID when synchronizing etc. It's not used for anything else inside DigiLEAN


## Dimension type text example

To post a dimension of type `text` or `description` you just post the text dimension along with the values and valueDate:

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 2,
    "dimension": "short text",
    "description": "long text"
}
```
