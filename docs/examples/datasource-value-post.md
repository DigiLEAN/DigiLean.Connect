# Add datavalue to datasource

## Simple example - just the value and valueDate

This is the simplest form of a DataValue. The fields `value` and `valueDate` is always required by default  

Request

```http
POST https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/498/values
content-type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00",
    "value": 2
}
```

Response

```http
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
location: /v1/datasources/1348/values/291411700
```

```json
{
  "id": 291411700,
  "dataSourceId": 1348,
  "registrationDate": "2024-10-14T12:26:15.8816103Z",
  "areaId": null,
  "assetId": null,
  "projectId": null,
  "value": 2,
  "description": null,
  "dimension": null,
  "dimension2": null,
  "dimension3": null,
  "dimension4": null,
  "valueDate": "2024-02-25T12:00:00Z",
  "externalId": null
}
```

## Include dimensions

The more advanced scenario of datavalues is by including one or more dimensions. This feature allows for filtering of data in DigiLEAN.

The nature of the dimensions are dynamic. So based on configuration the values that is to be posted vary

### The configuration

The configuration is set up in the DigiLEAN web client, but it can be read by the API:

```http
GET https://connect.digilean.tools/v1/datasources/1348
content-type: application/json
```

Response

```json
{
  "id": 498,
  "title": "1A API documentation",
  "description": "API documentation",
  "objectSource": "external",
  "unitOfTime": "DAY",
  "primaryInputSource": "manual",
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": 707,
      "label": "Plain text",
      "type": "text",
      "isMandatory": true,
      "sourceColumn": "dimension",
      "dataSourceId": 498
    }
  ]
}
```

Inspect the `elements` array of the response here. 

The three important properties are
`sourceColumn` - which column in the data object
`type` - what kind of data is it
`isMandatory` - whether the field is required


### The dimension columns
 - dimension
 - dimension2
 - dimension3
 - dimension4
 - description (long text)

### The different types

 - text: free text up to 100 characters
 - description: free text up to 255 characters
 - number: double
 - bool: true or false
 - list: Id from a DataList. The config will contain a `dataListId` field as well for this option
